        <p id="info">Are you ready for a chilling walk down Memory Lane? Here once kept games both dead and alive. Some say that due to all the hard work and innovative nature of the games cared for they haven't finished their course yet. Are there are still patients and ghosts that haunt this ground? It's been locked up for years, dare you to take a look for yourself?</p>
        <p id="info">Word says though you can not enter until the year 2029, though no one knows for sure why. Rumor has it that you can catch a glimpse inside before it's open but those who are not welcome are not allowed to stay for long. It really makes me wonder... What happened to the ones who created the games. Where have they gone? Are they welcome? Is all that work just... gone?</p>
