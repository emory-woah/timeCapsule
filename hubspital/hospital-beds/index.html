      <p>Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser to earn as many points as possible. Now existing in mainly Dave & Busters arcades it finds itself running out of the popular gaming era existing mainly as a pop culture reference.</p>
      <p>Pac-man is one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s. all versions of Pac-Man are estimated to have grossed over $12 billion in total revenue. Pac-Man established the conventions of the maze chase genre, and is considered to be one of the classics in video game history and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Though today exists as a nostalgia trip at various barcades and online sites.</p>
      <p>The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Doctor Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos Emeralds. The gameplay involves collecting rings and relies on speed and momentum to get through each level. Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platform video game. While Sonic remains a mascot for Sega he finds himself falling away from the classic aesthetic trying to break back into the hearts of those that played before but often falling short.</p>
      <p>Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. In Team Fortress 2, players join one of two teams comprising nine character classes, battling in a variety of game modes including capture the flag and king of the hill. While TF2 received critical acclaim as a breakthrough in its genre, it struggles to keep up with its many competitors making little to no new users as it proceeds.</p>
