      <h1 id="head">Lunar Lander 1979</h1>
      <p id="info">Lunar Lander is a single-player arcade game. In the game, the player controls a lunar landing module as viewed from the side and attempts to land safely on the Moon. Lunar Lander proved commercially successful. Cash Box noted in September 1979 that the machines were very popular with customers. And thought, with all of this behind it, as well as pioneering a genre of games, it still finds itself fading into obscurity.
