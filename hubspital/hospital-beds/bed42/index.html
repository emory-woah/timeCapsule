      <p id="info">Contra is a video game series produced by Konami composed primarily of run and gun-style shoot-'em-ups. The series debuted in 1987 as a coin-operated arcade game simply titled Contra, which was followed by the release of Super Contra in 1988 and several sequels produced for various home platforms, and, as it’s last installment came in 2011 it’s not finding any more success hanging on.</p>
