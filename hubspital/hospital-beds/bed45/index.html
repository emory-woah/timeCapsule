RuneScape takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. The game had received a huge burst in popularity in its original run, and though it still exists, has yet to innovate or switch up itâ€™s gameplay or existence making way for a swift decline.</p>
