      <p id="info">Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. The game features an anthropomorphic hedgehog named Sonic in a quest to defeat Doctor Robotnik, a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful Chaos Emeralds. While Sonic may be one of the most widely known video gaming characters he seems to be more of a mascot than a means for successful games.</p>
