      <p id="info">Warcraft is a franchise of video games, novels, and other media created by Blizzard Entertainment. The series is made up of five core games finding success in sequels that quickly lost traction as MMORPGâ€™s tend to do. It was massively innovative for the time and while still played by many seems to find no new fans. </p>
