      <h1 id="head">Earthbound 1994</h1>
      <p id="info">EarthBound subverted popular role-playing game traditions by featuring a real world setting while parodying numerous staples of the genre as Ness and his party of four, the player travels the world to collect eight melodies in order to defeat the evil alien force Giygas. Though Initial reviewers had little praise for EarthBound in the United States. It’s largely due to it’s prequel not receiving an American release and it’s poor advertising campaign leaving the characters to be mere vessels for the uber successful Super Smash Brothers.</p>
