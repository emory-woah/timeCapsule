      <p id="info">Half-Life is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation for Microsoft Windows in 1998. The core gameplay consists of fighting alien and human enemies with a variety of weapons and solving puzzles. Though the game garnered a sequel in the mid-2000’s the game never received a third game sending it into a meme like state of “Where is Half-Life 3” though the game doesn’t seem to be coming back.</p>
