      <p id="info">The first game in the series is titled Dragon's Lair, originally released for the arcades in 1983 by Cinematronics. It offered greatly superior graphics compared to other video games at the time. The game was ported to several other platforms, but has no home system as no technology of that era could accommodate it’s graphical quality. And though it garnered a sequel it lives as more of a reference than a game.</p>
