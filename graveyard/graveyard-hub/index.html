      <p>In Asteroids you shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases. And, while it became Atari's best selling arcade game of all time, with over 70,000 units sold. Asteroids has become a memory only found when sought out.</p>
      <p>Tetris is a classic puzzle game inspiring numerous others. The objective of the game is to manipulate Tetriminos, by moving each one sideways and/or rotating, so that they form a solid horizontal line with no gaps on the field. The game, or one of its many variants, is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system however finds itself as a mere memory.</p>
      <p>Street Fighter II is a competitive fighting game developed by Capcom and released for arcades in 1991. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. And while the series has risen to great heights it has begun a slow descent of losing fans and leaving very little memory of some of it's most iconic installments much like this one.</p>
      <p>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game takes place in the year 2011, only a few years in the future and attempts to display a more modern and advanced form of warfare for the time. The game received universal acclaim from critics for gameplay and story, while criticism targeted the failure of the game to substantially innovate the first-person shooter genre, which in the current gaming climate is a devastating blow for any series leaving the game to fall away.</p>
