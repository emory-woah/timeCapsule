      <p id="info">Silent Hill is a survival horror video that follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, and is also considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made. It was to be continued in 2015 but was abruptly ended due to differences between the producers and the creators. Silent Hill games are now officially dead.</p>
