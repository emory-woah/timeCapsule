      <p id="morewords"> Super Mario Galaxy is a 2007 platform game for the Wii, and the third 3D game in Nintendo's Super Mario series. The levels in the game consist of galaxies filled with minor planets and worlds, with different variations of gravity, the central element of gameplay. The player controls the player character using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and completes missions, fights bosses, and reaches certain areas to collect Power Stars. Certain levels use the motion-based Wii Remote functions. Super Mario Galaxy was a critical and commercial success, hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time. This success has inspired games like Super Mario Odyssey and has also warranted it HD remakes keeping the love and success alive
